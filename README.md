Remember to take your time and work through each question diligently! Test your code, make sure it works, and try to find ways to improve. Once you are happy and satisfied with your code, upload it to Github, then turn in your Github link at the bottom of the page!

Don't forget. Make sure this assignment is in it's own repository. Not mixed in with others!

Advanced Operations on Python Lists
Objective: Understand Python lists by exploring more complex operations, such as list comprehension, slicing, and sorting, and analyzing their time and space complexities.

Problem Statement: Delve deeper into Python lists and master advanced operations. Implement various complex tasks using lists and analyze their efficiency in terms of time and space complexities.

Task 1

Implement a function to create a new list using list comprehension that contains squares of numbers from 1 to n, where n is a parameter. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Task 2

Implement a function to reverse a sublist within a list from index i to j (inclusive). Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation
Task 3

Implement a function to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Expected Outcomes:

Students should demonstrate proficiency in using advanced list operations such as list comprehension, slicing, and sorting.
Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexities of complex list operations and understand their performance implications.
Students should develop problem-solving skills by tackling more complex tasks using Python lists.
General Tips:

Test your functions with different input sizes to observe their performance.
Utilize Python's built-in functions and methods for efficiency where appropriate.
Use resources like timeit module for measuring execution time and sys.getsizeof() for estimating memory usage.
Dictionary Manipulation and Optimization
Objective: Understand Python dictionaries by exploring advanced manipulation techniques and optimization strategies.

Problem Statement: Explore advanced manipulation techniques and optimization strategies for Python dictionaries. Implement various dictionary operations and optimize them for improved performance.

Task 1

Implement a function to merge two dictionaries, preserving the values of common keys from the second dictionary. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Task 2

Implement a function to find the intersection of two dictionaries, i.e., keys common to both dictionaries along with their values. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Task 3

Implement a function to count the frequency of each unique word in a list using a dictionary. Analyze the time and space complexity of this operation.
Expected Outcomes:

Students should demonstrate proficiency in using advanced dictionary manipulation techniques and optimization strategies.
Students should be able to analyze the time and space complexities of complex dictionary operations and understand their performance implications.
Students should develop optimization skills by implementing efficient algorithms for dictionary manipulation.
General Tips:

Test your functions with different input sizes to observe their performance.
Utilize Python's built-in functions and methods for efficiency where appropriate.
Use resources like timeit module for measuring execution time and sys.getsizeof() for estimating memory usage.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your file and clicks the run button at the top, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, print statements, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
